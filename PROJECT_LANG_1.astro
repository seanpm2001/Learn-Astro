// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-Astro
// About:
// I decided to make Astro the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Astro) as Astro is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Astro progrmaming language. It only makes sense to Astro the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
